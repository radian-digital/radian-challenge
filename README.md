# Radian Technology Challenge



This is a basic starter application using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org), [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com|Material-UI), and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

The challenge is to make the application functional: you can make it sortable, filterable, styled, responsive, interactive, authenticated, etc. 
You can make any changes you deem necessary. You can pull in any dependencies you would like to showcase as well. The only restrictions are it must be built with Nextjs, Material-UI as the component library, and some data fetching with Apollo - but as aforementioned, if you would like to do more, then by all means. 

The goal is to give us some insights into how you work, how you would structure an application, component design and modularity, linting configs, etc. If you have time to write a few tests, that would also be great. 

React: Hooks, composition, and state management
Nextjs: SSG vs ISR vs SSR (you don't need to implement all three, just understanding the difference), routing concepts, including dynamic routes
Apollo: Basic usage


Relax and Have Fun - This isn't a test with right or wrong answers. It is the opportunity for us to discuss decisions and help us understand your process and also for you to learn about us
