# Radian Technology Challenge



This is a basic starter application using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org), [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com|Material-UI), and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

The challenge is to make the application functional: you can make it searchable, sortable, filterable, styled, responsive, interactive, authenticated, etc. 
You can make any changes you deem necessary. You can pull in any dependencies you would like to showcase as well. The only restrictions are it must be built with Nextjs, Material-UI as the component library, and some data fetching with Apollo - but as aforementioned, if you would like to do more, then by all means. You can use the Github GraphQL API, or you can use another GraphQL API to fetch and display data.  

The goal is to give us some insights into how you work, how you would structure an application, component design and modularity, linting configs, etc. The format is open for you to choose what you want to showcase, we don't expect it be a full fledged application or exhibit all of the features mentioned. If you have time to write a few tests, that would be a bonus. 


  * __React:__ Hooks, composition, and state management 
  * __Nextjs:__ SSG vs ISR vs SSR (you don't need to implement all three, just understanding the difference), routing concepts, including dynamic routes 
  * __Apollo:__ Basic usage 
  * __Material-UI:__ Component model, jss, general usage 


Relax and Have Fun - This isn't a test with just right or wrong answers. It is the opportunity for us to discuss decisions and help us understand your process and also for you to learn about us.
